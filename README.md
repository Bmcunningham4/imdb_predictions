# Finally a project to get me excited about data science again and can use my sklearn knowledge as well as k-nearest neighbors classification!

Going to save this project for next week:
22/01/24 onwards!!

Ideas
- Potential note to make this more interesting, once I've come up with the predictive rating I could use my new ascii art skills to rate the movie in stars and use the rating as a percentage  x 5 Stars eg. show 8.7 of the stars...
- Have seperate files with diff bits of analysis briefly like my avg ratings over diff years etc, most ratings in a year etc.. avg ratings, range for each genres.. 
- Predictions for diff times of classifications eg. Tree, classifiers, weighted K-nearest neighbors!






#! ------Next project----
# After this one use fanfooty to get previous seasons results and make a predictive model for the 2024 AFL season!
